# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Geographic Location Classification
## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images based on their geographic location. The model is trained on a dataset of images, where each image is associated with a specific location tag (e.g., city, country, landmark). The goal is to build a robust model capable of predicting the location of a new, unseen image.

This project is a great example of applying deep learning techniques to a real-world computer vision problem.

## Key Features
Geographic Image Classification: Trains a deep learning model to accurately classify images into predefined geographic categories.

Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes scripts for preparing and augmenting image data to improve model performance and generalization.

Model Training & Evaluation: Provides a clear process for training the CNN model and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

Predictive Inference: Allows for the classification of new, single images after the model has been trained.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

TensorFlow / Keras: The primary deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.

NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and data manipulation.

Pandas: Used for handling and processing dataset information (if applicable).

Matplotlib: For visualizing model performance (e.g., training/validation curves).

Scikit-learn: For data splitting and performance evaluation.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Running the Code
Dataset: The code expects a structured dataset. Place your image data in a directory with subfolders for each location category (e.g., data/paris/, data/tokyo/).

## Training the Model:
Run the main training script. You may need to specify the path to your dataset.
