Landmark classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Models include a CNN built from scratch & a transfer learning model using the vgg16 architecture. Pytorch & Python 3 are used to build the models. Models automatically predict the location of the image based on the landmark shown in the image. Machine learning design process is followed end to end: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNN's, comparing the accuracy of different CNN's.
